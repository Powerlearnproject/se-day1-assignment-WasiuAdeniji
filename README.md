Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
The importance of software engineering cannot be over-emphasized as it provides the foundation for creating robust, efficient and user-friendly software systems, making it a vital discipline in today's technology driven world. It enables the creation of software systems that power various aspects of human life including healthcare, communication, entertainment etc.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
AI and Machine Learning integration [2020s]: These integrations into software engineering have given birth to technologies which are used for automating tasks, enhancing software capabilities and improving decision-making processes.
DevOps and Continuous Integration [2010s]: The emergence of DevOps practices focuses on the integration of development and operations to improve collaboration automate workflows, and enhance the continuous delivery of software. Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) became integral parts of modern software development.
Agile Methodologies [2000s]: The rise of Agile methodologies advocates for iterative development, collaboration and responsivenes to change. It emphasizes principles like delivering working software frequently and valuing customer collaboration over contract negotiation.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: This involves the gathering and documenting of user needs and systems requirements.
Design: This is the stage where high-level and detailed designs of the softwares architecture and user interface are created.
Implemetation: At this stage of the SDLC, codes are written and softwares are built according to specifications.
Testing: The software undergoes various tests to ensure that quality standards and functional requirements are met
Deployment: The developed software is released to the user or customer
Maintenance: On-going support, updates and enhancements are provided to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
